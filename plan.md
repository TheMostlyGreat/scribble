## **Work Plan**

### **Phase 1: Project Setup and Initialization**

1. **Environment Setup**
   a. Install Flutter SDK using a package manager:
      - For macOS:
        - Use Homebrew: `brew install --cask flutter`
 
      
   b. Verify and configure Flutter:
      - Run `flutter doctor` to check for missing dependencies
      - Install missing dependencies:
        1. Android toolchain:
           ```bash
           # Install Android Studio using Homebrew
           brew install --cask android-studio

           # Open Android Studio and follow the setup wizard to install Android SDK
           # This step is manual and requires user interaction

           # Set the ANDROID_HOME environment variable to point to the SDK location
           echo 'export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk' >> ~/.zshrc

           # Add Android SDK tools and platform-tools to the system PATH
           echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools' >> ~/.zshrc

           # Reload the shell configuration to apply changes
           source ~/.zshrc
           ```

        2. Xcode:
           - Install Xcode from the App Store
           - Go through the set up process

   c. Set up the integrated development environment (IDE):
      - Choose between VS Code or Android Studio
      - For VS Code:
        - Install VS Code
        - Install the Flutter and Dart extensions
        - Configure Flutter SDK path in VS Code settings
      - For Android Studio:
        - Install Android Studio
        - Install the Flutter and Dart plugins
        - Configure Flutter SDK path in Android Studio settings
   
   d. Set up platform-specific development tools:
      - For mobile:
        - Install Android SDK and set up Android emulator
        - For iOS, install Xcode (on macOS) and set up iOS simulator
      - For web:
        - Ensure Chrome browser is installed for debugging
      - For desktop:
        - On Windows, install Visual Studio with "Desktop development with C++" workload
        - On macOS, install Xcode command line tools
        - On Linux, install required libraries (e.g., gtk3, ninja-build)

   e. Verify setup:
      - Run `flutter devices` to check available devices/platforms
      - Create and run a sample Flutter app on each target platform

2. **Project Creation**
   - Create a new Flutter project with web support:
     ```bash
     flutter create my_app
     cd my_app
     flutter config --enable-web
     ```

3. **Version Control**
   - Initialize a Git repository for source control.
   - Set up a remote repository on a platform like GitHub or GitLab.

### **Phase 2: UI Design and Development**

1. **Three-Pane Layout Design**
   - **File Structure Pane**: Use `ListView` to display a list of files and folders.
   - **Editor Pane**: Integrate Fleather for rich text editing and Git-style diff visualization.
   - **Chatbot Interface Pane**: Use `Column` and `TextField` for chat messages and input.

2. **Implementation**
   - Use a `Row` widget to arrange the three panes horizontally.
   - Allocate space using `Expanded` widgets with appropriate `flex` values.

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes using `MediaQuery` and `LayoutBuilder`.

### **Phase 3: Editor Pane with Fleather and Git-Style Diffs**

1. **Fleather Integration**
   - Add Fleather to your project dependencies in `pubspec.yaml`:
     ```yaml
     dependencies:
       fleather: ^1.18.0
     ```

2. **Setup Fleather Editor**
   - Create a `FleatherController` and initialize it with a `ParchmentDocument`.
   - Use `FleatherEditor` and `FleatherToolbar` to provide a rich text editing experience.

3. **Git-Style Diff Visualization**
   - Integrate a library or custom solution to visualize AI-proposed changes using Git-style diffs.
   - Ensure the diffs are intuitive and easy to navigate within the editor pane.

### **Phase 4: Chatbot and AI Integration**

1. **Chatbot Development**
   - Implement a chatbot interface using a `Column` for chat history and a `TextField` for input.
   - Integrate natural language processing capabilities to enhance interaction.

2. **AI-Driven Suggestions**
   - Develop AI algorithms to propose changes to the document.
   - Ensure seamless integration with the Git-style diff visualization for easy review.

### **Phase 5: Real-Time Collaboration**

1. **Collaboration Features**
   - Implement features for simultaneous editing, shared cursors, and presence indicators.
   - Use WebSockets or similar technology for real-time data synchronization.

2. **Collaboration Tools**
   - Develop tools for commenting, suggesting edits, and managing permissions.

### **Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance**

1. **Unit and Integration Testing**
   - Write unit tests for core functionalities.
   - Implement integration tests to ensure seamless interaction between components.

2. **Cross-Platform Testing**
   - Test the application on different platforms (iOS, Android, web, desktop) for compatibility and performance.

### **Phase 7: Deployment**

1. **Preparation**
   - Prepare the app for deployment on various platforms, ensuring compliance with platform-specific guidelines.

2. **Release**
   - Deploy the application to app stores (Google Play, Apple App Store) and web hosting services.

## **Design Overview**

### **UI Components**

- **File Structure Pane**: Displays a hierarchical view of files and folders using `ListView`.
- **Editor Pane**: Central pane for rich text editing using Fleather and displaying Git-style diffs for AI-proposed changes.
- **Chatbot Interface Pane**: Contains a chat history and input field for user interaction.

### **Architecture**

- **Plugin System**: Modular architecture allowing plugins to extend app functionality.
- **State Management**: Use a state management solution like Provider or Riverpod for managing app state across components.

### **User Experience**

- **Intuitive Navigation**: Ensure easy navigation between files and panes.
- **Interactive Diffs**: Provide a clear and interactive view of text differences.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapt UI to various screen sizes and orientations.
